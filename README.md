# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Game features
1. A controable moving snake eating food.
2. Once the snake easts food, it grows in length and its speed inreases.
3. A moving obstacle randomly changing his direction as soon as the snake changes its direction.
4. The moving obstacle grows in length and increases its speed every time the snake eats food.
5. Once the snake's head hits any part of moving obstacle's body, the snake dies and the game is over.


## Rubic Points:
* Loops functions I/O: e.g.: Game::checkForCollision, Game::GetRandomDirection
* Object Oriented Programming Techniques: movingObstacle instance
* Appropriate access specifiers for class members: Snake class and movingObstacle instance
* Member initialization list in class constructor: initializing head_x and head_y as shared pointers in class snake
* Classes encapsulate behavior: private member variables are accessed via member functions
* Using references in function declatation: Game::checkForCollision
* Rule of five: snake.h 
* Smart pointers: shared pointers in snake.h for head and body
* Using move semantics to move data instead of copying it: Snake::UpdateBody
* Using two threads (main and game). The game thread is instantiated in main
* Using promise-future channel to send massage from working thread to parent thread (see end of Game::Run method)
